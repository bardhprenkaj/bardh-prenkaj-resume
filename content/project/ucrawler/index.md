• Built a universal and fully customisable web crawler with flexible scraping actions defined by the user.

• Expanded the resilience of the crawler by implementing a captcha-resistant mechanism by structuring classes that interacting with Selenium web browser.

• Engineered a solution to maintain already crawler web pages in local storage through a Lucene Index.

• Devised an approach to load locally memorised web pages when the crawler is executed offline.
