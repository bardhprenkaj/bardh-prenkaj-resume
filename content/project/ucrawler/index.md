title: 
Universal Crawler - Concurrent Distributed and Highly Configurable and Flexible Next Generation Crawler
summary: BAE is an unsupervised ensemble method that, similarly to boosting, builds an
adaptive cascade of autoencoders to achieve improved and robust results. BAE trains the autoencoder components sequentially by performing a weighted sampling of the data, aimed at reducing the amount of outliers used during training, and at injecting diversity in the ensemble.

• Built a universal and fully customisable web crawler with flexible scraping actions defined by the user.

• Expanded the resilience of the crawler by implementing a captcha-resistant mechanism by structuring classes that interacting with Selenium web browser.

• Engineered a solution to maintain already crawler web pages in local storage through a Lucene Index.

• Devised an approach to load locally memorised web pages when the crawler is executed offline.
