I obtained my M.Sc. and PhD in Computer Science from the Sapienza University of Rome in 2018 and 2022, respectively. I then worked as a senior researcher at the Department of Computer Science in Sapienza. Here, I led a team of 4 junior researchers and 6 software engineers in devising novel anomaly detection strategies for social isolation disorders. Since October 2022, I've been a postdoc at Sapienza in eXplainable AI and Anomaly Detection. 

I am part of and actively collaborate with Italian and international research groups ([RDS](https://www.gov.sot.tum.de/rds/overview/) of TU Munich, [PINlab](https://www.pinlab.org/) of Sapienza, [AIIM](http://aiim.disim.univaq.it/) of L'Aquila). I serve as a Program Committee (PC) member for conferences such as ICCV, CVPR, KDD, CIKM, and ECAI. I actively contribute as a reviewer for journals, including TKDE, TKDD, VLDB, TIST, and KAIS.

In June 2023 I joined the Chair of [Responsible Data Science](https://www.gov.sot.tum.de/rds/overview/) at TU Munich lead by prof. Kasneci to work on counterfactual explainability (_external researcher_).
