Currently a postdoc in ML Privacy and Security at the Technical University of Munich.

From 10/2022 to 10/2024, I was a postdoc at Sapienza in anomaly detection and explainability. During this period (June-September 2023), I spent time at my current research group, [RDS](https://www.gov.sot.tum.de/rds/overview/) working on graph counterfactual explainability.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Sapienza University of Rome in 2022 with a thesis on "Latent Deep Sequential Learning of Behavioural Sequences". In Rome, I worked in the [AIIM](https://aiimlab.org/) - formerly [IIM](https://iim.di.uniroma1.it/) - group advised by [Paola Velardi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=yf0g6zkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Giovanni Stilo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uTyaicMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I then worked as a senior researcher at the Department of Computer Science in Sapienza in anomaly detection for social isolation disorders (February - September 2022). 

I made [BetterScholar](https://betterscholar.org/) with [Antonio Norelli](https://noranta4.com/), an alternative to Google Scholar profiles. Read more here: [Why BetterScholar?](https://medium.com/@noranta4/why-betterscholar-051ffff7e46d)
