title: Machine Learning course 2022/23
summary: Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from data in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following "strictly static" program instructions. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to virtually any scientific and non-scientific field (health, security and cyber-security, management, finance, automation, robotics, marketing)
