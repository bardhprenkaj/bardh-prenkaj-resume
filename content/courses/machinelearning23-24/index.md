**Introduction to Machine Learning with Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost**

Lesson Overview: In this lesson, we will cover the basics of machine learning using three popular algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost. We'll start by exploring how to process data with both categorical and continuous features, followed by a step-by-step implementation of each algorithm.

游목 Data Processing: In this section, we load the dataset, separate features and target variable, and encode categorical features using OneHotEncoding. This step prepares the data for training our machine learning models
