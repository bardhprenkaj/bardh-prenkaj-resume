title: Bioinformatics course 2022/23
summary: The complexity and amount of biomolecular and genomic data available today requires the use of computational methods both for their management and above all for the extraction of biological and functional information. Bioinformatics is the discipline that deals with the analysis and attribution of biological meaning to the amount of molecular data available to date and represents an essential tool in the field of biochemical, biological-molecular, biomedical and biotechnological activities.

**Introduction to bioinformatics course**

This lesson illustrates the scientific field in which Bioinformatics operates. The term "Bioinformatics" today is difficult to define because it now encompasses many different activities. Our course will deal with the most "classical" part of bioinformatics and will try to give the basic concepts on which everyone can build their growth and sectoral knowledge.

🡢 Tips for becoming a good computational biologist

🡢 A fun guide to becoming a bioinformatician

**Biological databases**

This lesson provides an overview of the databases available in the field of molecular biology. The databases are very numerous and this lesson will help the student to make some orders so as not to get lost in the labyrinths of the network.

🡢 Databases may contain errors!

🡢 Example of a file included in the EMBL / ENA database

🡢 Expasy - The portal of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics through which you can access many interesting and useful resources on the Internet.

**Alignment of two sequences**

This lesson illustrates the basic methods most commonly used to compare amino acid or nucleotide sequences.

🡢 EMBOSS Tools at EBI

🡢 Comparison of genomes

🡢 Points of Significance: Significance, P-values, and T-tests

🡢 Highlights: The Importance of Being Uncertain

🡢 What is dynamic programming?

**Scoring matrices**

This lesson introduces scoring matrices used to align or compare protein sequences. The meaning of the points contained in the matrix cells is clarified by examining the logic underlying their calculation.

**Database searches**

This lesson describes the main sequence database search programs, such as FASTA and BLAST. After reviewing the problems inherent in rapidly searching for sequence similarities in databases of increasing size, technical solutions that have been proposed by various authors are illustrated. Some suggestions are also given for frontier developments in the genomic era.

🡢 Using BLAST

🡢 BlastX and TblastN

🡢 FASTA - The University of Virginia portal for accessing the FASTA program and its various versions. There are other portals at other institutions, easily identifiable through a Google search. Note the GGSEARCH and SSSEARCH versions which use an exact algorithm (Needleman & Wunsch and Smith & Waterman respectively) instead of a heuristic algorithm like FASTA

🡢 FASTA and Blast in EBI

**Molecular docking**

Molecular docking is a key tool in structural molecular biology and computer-aided drug design. The goal of ligand-protein binding is to predict the predominant mode(s) of binding of a ligand to a protein of known three-dimensional structure. Successful docking methods efficiently search high-dimensional spaces and use a scoring function that correctly ranks candidate dockings. Docking can be used to perform virtual screening of large compound libraries, rank the results, and propose structural hypotheses about how ligands inhibit the target, which is invaluable in lead optimization. Setting the input structures for docking is as important as the docking itself, and analyzing the results of stochastic search methods can sometimes be ambiguous. This chapter discusses the background and theory of molecular docking software and covers the use of some of the most commonly cited docking software.
