summary: This paper compares machine learning methods for risk prediction in event trajectories and provides insights on their reproducibility and applicability.
abstract: In this paper, we compare  several deep and surface state-of-the-art machine learning methods for risk prediction in problems that can be modelled as a trajectory of events separated by irregular time intervals. Trajectories are the abstract representation of many real-life  data, such as patient records, student e-tivities, online financial transactions, and many others. Given the continuously increasing number of machine learning methods to predict future high-risk events in these contexts, we aim to provide more insight into reproducibility and applicability of these methods when changing datasets, parameters, and evaluation measures. As an additional contribution, we release to the community the implementations of all compared methods.
